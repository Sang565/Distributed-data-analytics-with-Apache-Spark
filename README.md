# Distributed data analytics with Spark


This Spark-based code is run at the A-Fog (Analytics Fog) tier in our proposed multi-layer stream and big data analytics platform to perform large-scale parking occupancy analytics (carpark-based hourly average) based on the long-term parking data stored in its HDFS.
